<p>
<b>Chapter 31</b> of the <i>"Using Linux"</i> book will teach you about HTML, 
which is used to create web pages. This document you are reading is a web 
page. To see how it was created, press <i>v</i> to view the source, or 
quit this program (press <i>q</i>, then <i>y</i>), then type: 
<b>less /var/doc/welcome.html</b>
The <i>less</i> command lets you read a file, and <i>/var/doc/welcome.html</i>
is where this document is stored.

<h1>Learn to program in C and C++</h1>
<p>
After completing the above, you are ready to learn <i>C</i>. C is a very 
powerful programming language. With it, you can write games, or any other 
programs. You can even write your own operating system! Linux, for example 
is written in C. Once you can program C, other languages are very easy to 
learn. Start reading the <i>Teach Yourself C</i> book available from the 
library. You can try out the examples in the book on this computer. As you 
try writing your own programs, you may crash this computer. Don't worry, 
just press the triangle button at the bottom of the computer case to restart 
this computer. 
</p><p>
To compile your program, use <i>gcc</i>, for example:<br/>
<i>gcc hello.c -o hello</i><br/>
The above will compile the hello.c program and create an executable file called <i>hello</i> You can now run the executable file by typing:<br/>
<i>./hello</i><br/>
Go ahead and try it from the command-line (meaning exit this program, then 
type the above)!
</p><p>
To edit your programs, you can use <i>vi</i>, or <i>nano</i>. Nano is easier, 
but you can also learn to use <i>vi</i> by reading <b>Chapter 19</b> of the 
<i>Using Linux</i> book. For example, to edit the hello.c program, at the 
command-line, type:<br/>
<i>nano hello.c</i><br/>
To exit the editor, press <i>Ctrl</i> and while holding it down, 
press <i>x</i>, then release both keys. This is shown as <i>^X</i> at the 
bottom of the screen. Press <i>Ctrl</i> and <i>g</i> to get more help.
