<h1>Where to start</h1>
<p>
Before learning to program this computer, you should 
learn about the Linux operating system. Please 
read through the <i>"Using Linux"</i> book that is available 
from the library. It will teach you about the command-line 
and how to edit files, etc. Start with <b>Chapter 1</b>, then you can 
skip the installation sections and jump straight to <b>Chapter 5</b>, 
because this computer already has Linux installed. This computer 
uses Ubuntu, so some things work slightly differently to the 
book (as the book is a little old). After <b>Chapter 5</b>, read 
<b>Chapters 14 to 20</b>. Then you will know how to use Linux quite well. 
You can skip anything you don't understand and come back to it later. 
Feel free to try out everything you learn on this computer, but 
be careful of accidentally deleting important files. Don't worry if 
you break this computer, it can be fixed or re-installed.
